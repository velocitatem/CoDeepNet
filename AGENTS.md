# UltiPlate the Ultimate Boilerplate
This project is a scafold for any imaginable project appart from mobile apps. Anything is buildable ranging from a simple webapp in streamlit, an API server, a machine learning project, a scraper program, anything powered by some sort of worker, a simple cli or just an SDK or python package. All easily deployable and managed via the Makefile.

Python dependencies are managed by using a .venv and a singular requirements.txt in the project root, you can use the make command to distribute the requirements and any env variables which are all synchronized in the .env file.

As an AI agent your interactions with the user will usually be noisy, you might be given some vision and you should use the available scaffold and tools to build it in a simple and maintainable way, you should not create rougue files or random test files/scripts. You might also be given existing code which implements some vision in a scattered way and you should translate that into a sustainable project within this given framework.
